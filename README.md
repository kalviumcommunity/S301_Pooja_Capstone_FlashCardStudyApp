Capstone Project: Flash Card Study App

Project Idea:
This project is a simple and interactive Flash Card Study App designed to help users learn and revise topics efficiently. Users can create, view, edit, and delete flashcards. Each flashcard will have a question on the front and the answer on the back. The app aims to enhance memory retention through visual repetition and categorization of topics.

Day-by-Day Plan:
Day 1: Set up GitHub repository and project folder structure
Day 2: Design low-fidelity wireframes and basic UI screens
Day 3: Implement flashcard creation and listing functionality
Day 4: Add edit and delete options for flashcards
Day 5: Implement card flip animations and category filtering
Day 6: Polish UI and add local storage or backend support
Day 7: Final testing, bug fixes, and deployment
